# The Pomodoro Technique

This is simple but effective webpage for using the Pomodoro Technique.
The idea behind the technique is that the timer instills a sense of urgency.
Rather than feeling like you have endless time in the workday to get things done and have any distractions, you know you only have 25 minutes to make as much progress on a task as possible.
It will help you stay focused and productive.

First is first. What is the Pomodoro Technique?

Starting Pomodoro starts the countdown for 25 mins.

After the completion of 25 mins, it suggests to take a break. However, it's the users choice.

Once the 5 mins are done, it reminds to start the work again.

And then, the user can repeat the process as many times as he can until his/her work is done.
